# SPECnet 
##### "Social Primitives Experimental Cohort" -- A Special Interest Group (SIG) affiliated with [CSSSA](https://computationalsocialscience.org/)

We're interested in using agent-based modeling (ABM) to explore the possible
social primitives that produce empirical patterns of economic (and other forms
of) inequality.

The SPEC**net** subproject, in particular, uses a social network as the key
modeling construct, rather than a 2d grid as in models like
[Sugarscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarscape) and
systems like [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

The additional project, which is complementary to SPECnet is [SPECscape](https://github.com/IngenuityArts/spcescape) and is based on the 2D grid approach noted above. The complimentarity is currently being proposed as follows:

SPECnet develops its approach with reference to SPECscape and SPECscape develops its approach with reference to SPECnet. They are, in a sense, independent but actively conscious in contrasting clearly where there are differences, build off commonalities, and seek useful complementarities where the differences turn out to be enhancements.

*I've added the above two paragraphs just to get the Git on but also, hopefully, as an idea that can fruitfully carry our work forward.
