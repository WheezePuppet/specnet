# SPECnet 
##### "Social Primitives Experimental Cohort" -- A Special Interest Group (SIG) affiliated with [CSSSA](https://computationalsocialscience.org/)

We're interested in using agent-based modeling (ABM) to explore the possible
social primitives that produce empirical patterns of economic (and other forms
of) inequality.

The SPEC**net** subproject, in particular, uses a social network as the key
modeling construct, rather than a 2d grid as in models like
[Sugarscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarscape) and
systems like [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).
